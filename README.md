# Project Overview

This project was used to help me learn how to use Jasmine and TDD.


## How to run this application

Clone or download this repository and open the index.html file. Jasmine is already inclued so it will also be loaded and will run the test suites.

Open the spec/feedreader.js file in an editor and make changes to the code to see the tests fail.
